# rust-simple-blog-api

I have wanted to learn Rust for a long time, I thought starting a simple project could make process of learning faster. So I want to create simple API using Rust.

### Roadmap
My roadmap will be like:
- (1) Initial Project
- (2) Blog List Endpoint (data served from memory)
- (3) Database integration
- (4) CRUD endpoints
- (5) Auth endpoints | JWT Authentication
- (6) OpenAPI(Swagger) integration
